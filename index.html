		<h2>A step by step walk through of your first HTML page</h2>

		<p>HTML is short for Hyper Text Markup Language. Basically it's the "code" behind every web page- even as this one.
		   If you are just beginning to learn HTML, let us tell you that it's fairly a easy task. HTML, without styling, can't do anything more that setting a layout, drawing a table or creating frames - but it is handy as it helps in structuring the content, which is important when you sit down to add style to your HTML.

		<img src="./stock1/tags.png" alt="tag" width="45%">
		<p>
			Tags are what you will see most when you'll look to an HTML source code. A tag can be seen as a wrapper to any item on any HTML document. Tags tell what magic is to be done to the content enclosed within them. 
		</p>
		<p>Let's look at two type of tags</p>
		<ol>
			<li>&lt;tag-example-one>I need a closing tag &lt;tag-example-one></li>
			<li>&lt;tag-example-two/> I don't need a closing tag</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags, the first one is called the opening tag and the seconnd one is called 
		   the closing tag. Everything in between is affected by the properties of the tag. Very commonly used examples of these tags are &lt;html>, &lt;body> etc.
		</p>
		<p>The second example tag is of the loner tag- as in they dont need a closing tag to funtion. Although its not important these types of
			tags are often written as &lt;tag/> to make the debugging of the code easier.<br/>Common examples of these type of tags are &lt;hr/> used for horizontal line.
