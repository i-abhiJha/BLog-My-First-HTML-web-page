		<h2>A step by step walk through of your first HTML page</h2>

		<img src="./stock1/main1.png" alt="A walk through">
		<p>HTML is short for Hyper Text Markup Language. Basically it's the "code" behind every web page- even as this one.
		   If you are just beginning to learn HTML, let us tell you that it's fairly a easy task. HTML, without styling, can't do anything more that setting a layout, drawing a table or creating frames - but it is handy as it helps in structuring the content, which is important when you sit down to add style to your HTML.   
		</p>
		<img src="./stock1/main2.jpeg" alt="an image of html codes" width="45%">
		<p>
			However simple it might seem, it is a mighty useful tool, when it comes to full fledged web development. Various tool easily eliminate the HTML coding from your work process - but if you want to be in full control of your web page, you will need to have command over HTML.
		</p>
		<p>
			Through this article, we aim to give you the basic essential HTML building blocks that will help you get and and running. Reading this you will be able to understand and HTML source code and even modify it for your own good!
		</p>

		<h3>Step one - TAGS</h3>
		<img src="./stock1/tags.png" alt="tag" width="45%">
		<p>
			Tags are what you will see most when you'll look to an HTML source code. A tag can be seen as a wrapper to any item on any HTML document. Tags tell what magic is to be done to the content enclosed within them. 
		</p>
		<p>Let's look at two type of tags</p>
		<ol>
			<li>&lt;tag-example-one>I need a closing tag &lt;tag-example-one></li>
			<li>&lt;tag-example-two/> I don't need a closing tag</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags, the first one is called the opening tag and the seconnd one is called 
		   the closing tag. Everything in between is affected by the properties of the tag. Very commonly used examples of these tags are &lt;html>, &lt;body> etc.
		</p>
		<p>The second example tag is of the loner tag- as in they dont need a closing tag to funtion. Although its not important these types of
			tags are often written as &lt;tag/> to make the debugging of the code easier.<br/>Common examples of these type of tags are &lt;hr/> used for horizontal line.
		</p>

		<h3>Step two - HTML, HEAD and BODY: The three pillers of your document</h3>
		<img src="./stock1/main2.jpg",alt="head and body tag">
		<p>
			These tags are essential for any HTML document. They parcel out the significant parts of your HTML code.
			<ul>
				<li> &lt;BODY>&lt;/BODY is placed below your &lt;HEAD> ta, and everything that you wnat to be displayedon your screen comes under this tag. Text, images, linkks, and pretty much anything your browser live inside this tag.</li>

				<li>&lt;HTML>&lt;/HTML> wraps your entire code. Everything else in your HTML document needs to come inside these tags</li>

				<li>&lt;HEAD>&lt;/HEAD> includes things like title, style, and scrips. Head is usually present at the top (hah!), just inside the &lt;/HTML> tag.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Step three - A few tags that'll make your page pretty</h3>
		<p>
			Now that you know how to set up the skeleton of your document, let's proceed with the things that will go inside your &lt;BODY> tag and do some magic!
		</p>
		<p>
			Some basic text formatting tags:
			<ul>
				<li>&lt;b> &lt;/b makes your text look <b>bold</b></li>

				<li>&lt;i>&lt;/i> makes you write in <i>cursive</i></li>

				<li>&lt;u>&lt;/u> <u>underlines</u> what you just wrote</li>
			</ul>
			For, example this piece of code
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<dl>
			<dt>&lt;html></dt>
			<dd>&lt;head> &lt;/head></dd>
			<dd></dd>
			<dd>
				<dl>
					<dt>&lt;body></dt>
					<dd><br></dd>
					<dd>&lt;i> I am italics! &lt;/i> &lt;br/></dd>
					<dd>&lt;b> I am bold! &lt;/b> &lt;;br/></dd>
					<dd>&lt;u> And me, well, I'm underlined! &lt;/u> &lt;br/></dd>
					<br>
				</dl>
			</dd>
			<dd>&lt;/body></dd>
			<dt>&lt;/html></dt>
		</dl>
		<hr/>
		<br>
		<p>
			Should prouduce something like this on your browser: Don't fret too much about the &lt;br/>. It's just for breaking the line so  that you can start from the next line. Enter key does little when it comes to changing lines in your HTML document. 
		</p>

		<h6><b>Tags to help you structure your content:</b></h6>
		<ul>
			<li>&lt;br/> breaks the line, making you continue to the next line.</li>
			<li>&lt;p> stands for paragraph. it divides your content into paragraphs.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<i>Note: You need to use these tags as space and enter keys do very little when it comes to formatting content inside an HTML document.</i>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h6>Heading Tags:</h6>
		<p>
			HTML provides you with six tags, from &lt;H1>&lt;H1> to &lt;H6>&lt;H6> to help you create different sized headers quickly.
		</p>
		<img src="./stock1/a2.png" alt="heading sizes">
		<h6>Inserting an Image</h6>
		<p>All that's good, but what fun without images on the webpage? Don't worry, &lt;IMG/> to the rescue! The image tag has a mandatory attribute called "source". Basically, it tells the browser where it should look for the image. The syntax goes something like:<br><br>
			<i>&lt;img src="path_to_your_image"/></i>
			<br><br>
			Furthermore, it also has attributes like height and width that let you specify the height and width you want your image to take.
		</p>
		<h6>Lists:</h6>
		<p>
			HTML has two types of lists- ordered and unordered. Each item of your list has to be inclosed in a tag. The syntax for creating a list is fairly simple.
		</p>
		<p>Suppose you want to create a list like:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Item 1</li>
			<li>Item 2</li>
			<li>Item 3</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		The following code will easily do the job for you:
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<dl>
			<dt>&lt;ul></dt>
				<dd>&lt;li> Item 1 &lt;/li></dd>
				<dd>&lt;li> Item 2 &lt;/li></dd>
				<dd>&lt;li> Item 3 &lt;/li></dd>
			<dt>&lt;/ul></dt>
		</dl>
		<hr/>
		<br>
		<p>This, by the way, was an example of an unordered list. For an ordered list, all you need to do is replace &lt;ul> with &lt;ol> and &lt;/ul> with &lt;/ol>.
